# ghostwriter-themes

[Ghostwriter](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter) is a multiplataform distraction-free [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) editor. while I consider it a pretty good piece of software, it is still lacking a good variety of themes so users can avoid monotony when they feel like. Here I will collect my experimental themes, and you are invited to contribute yours.

## Theme Documentation

[Wereturtle](https://github.com/wereturtle), the developer of Ghostwriter, has now documented the [Theme spec](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter/wiki/Theme-File-Format). You should read it there before you venture into theme-making. This is only a rough crash-course for beginners who just want to know where themes are and where they must put new themes.

If you have created some themes and don't want to create a repository of your own, feel free to add them here.
